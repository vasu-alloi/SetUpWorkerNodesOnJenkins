### Ephemeral Workers on AWS EC2 (recommended for scalability)

This way workers spin up only when needed.

### Steps:

### Install EC2 Plugin in Jenkins:

Manage Jenkins â†’ Plugin Manager â†’ Available â†’ EC2 Plugin.

### Configure EC2 cloud:

Manage Jenkins â†’ Nodes â†’ Clouds â†’ Add a new cloud â†’ Amazon EC2.

Provide AWS credentials + region.

Define an AMI with Java + build tools (or use Amazon Linux/Ubuntu and init script).

### Configure templates:

Set instance type (e.g., t3.medium).

Remote root directory = /home/jenkins.

Labels = ec2-agent.

Launch method = SSH (Jenkins will inject keys).

Test:

Run a pipeline with agent { label 'ec2-agent' }.

Jenkins will spin up EC2 â†’ run job â†’ terminate after use.


### 1. Jenkins Master Node

Upgrade Instance Type â†’ If your Jenkins master is slow (UI lag, queue delays, config saves taking long), increasing instance type (e.g., t3.medium â†’ t3.large or even m5.large) helps.

Storage â†’ Move /var/lib/jenkins to gp3 / io2 EBS for faster I/O.

Reserved Instance â†’ Since Jenkins master should be always running, better to use Reserved Instance (RI) or Savings Plan.

On-Demand = flexibility, higher cost.

RI = predictable workload, cheaper (30â€“70% savings).

âœ… Recommendation: Keep master on On-Demand or Reserved (not Spot), since you donâ€™t want your control plane to die.

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Jenkins Worker Nodes

### Hereâ€™s the big decision point:

Option A: Static Worker Nodes

You provision EC2 worker nodes permanently.

Simple, but costly (workers may sit idle).

Option B: Ephemeral Worker Nodes (Recommended)

Use EC2 Auto Scaling Group (with Spot + On-Demand mix).

Jenkins EC2 plugin launches workers only when jobs are queued.

Worker terminates after job â†’ saves cost, improves scalability.

âœ… Recommendation: Ephemeral worker nodes via ASG (EC2 plugin).
This ensures:

Jobs donâ€™t hog the master.

You scale on-demand.

Cheaper (use Spot workers safely).

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Performance Tuning

Plugins â†’ Remove unused plugins (too many = slow Jenkins).

JVM Tuning â†’ Add flags like -Xms1G -Xmx4G (depending on master size).

Garbage Collection â†’ Use G1GC for smoother memory handling.

Logs & Builds Cleanup â†’ Enable automatic log rotation & job history cleanup.

Storage â†’ Ensure builds/artifacts are on S3 or external storage, not filling /var/lib/jenkins.

ðŸŽ¯ My Recommendation (as your Jenkins Manager)

Master: Run on m5.large or c5.large On-Demand/Reserved (never Spot).

Workers: Run ephemeral workers using ASG + Spot instances (saves cost, scalable).

Performance: Audit plugins, tune JVM, and move artifacts/logs to S3.

ðŸ‘‰ This way, your master is stable (always up), while your workers are elastic & cost-efficient.
